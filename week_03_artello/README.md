# Week 03 - Artello

Artello Creative is a conceptual NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ecommerce auction app that aims to provide a platform for artists and collectors to engage in the world of digital art and collectibles. Artello and all the concepts are owned by Afterflow.

## Project Type

This is a **UI Challenge** project.

## Project Overview

The project has been built using Flutter SDK v3.10.0 and Dart SDK v3.0.0. Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google, which allows for fast and efficient development of high-quality apps for multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web, and desktop.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to recreate the visual design of [this concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/18206861-Artello-Creative-NFT-Ecommerce-Auction-App "Dribble Artello Creative NFT Ecommerce Auction App") using Flutter widgets. The project will involve replicating the layout, color scheme, typography, images, and other visual elements.

## Why this Project?

I took up this project as a challenge to improve my Flutter development skills and to gain experience in replicating complex designs using Flutter.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, ensure that you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. This project is already set up to use Flutter Version Manager (FVM), which allows you to manage multiple versions of Flutter on your system.

Alternatively, you can use your preferred IDE or code editor to run the project. Please ensure that you have the correct version of Flutter (v3.10.0) and Dart (v3.0.0) installed on your system.
